    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are one of the fastest growing startups in the logistics and delivery domain. We work with several partners and make on-demand delivery to our customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing several different challenges and everyday we are trying to address these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thrive on making our customers happy. As a growing startup, with a global expansion strategy we know that we need to make our customers happy and the only way to do that is to measure how happy each customer is. If we can predict what makes our customers happy or unhappy, we can then take necessary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting feedback from customers is not easy either, but we do our best to get constant feedback from our customers. This is a crucial function to improve our operations across all levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recently did a survey to a select customer cohort. You are presented with a subset of this data. We will be using the remaining data as a private test set."

    "- Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers\n",
    "- X1 = my order was delivered on time\n",
    "- X2 = contents of my order was as I expected\n",
    "- X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order\n",
    "- X4 = I paid a good price for my order\n",
    "- X5 = I am satisfied with my courier\n",
    "- X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5 where the smaller number indicates less and the higher number indicates more towards the answer.\n",

    "**Bonus(es):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very interested in finding which questions/features are more important when predicting a customerâ€™s happiness. Using a feature selection approach show us understand what is the minimal set of attributes/features that would preserve the most information about the problem while increasing predictability of the data we have. Is there any question that we can remove in our next survey?"

Some of the analysis made include: target feature distribution, feature composition, feature behaviour against target variable, feature correlation and hypothesis testing using the chi square test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **<u>Models</u>** section is divided in two main parts: the overview section and the selected models section. In the first one many classification models are tested to analyse what baseline models obtained the best results. Subsequently the selected models selection tests three models: logistic regression, ADA boost classifier, LGBM classifier. For the latter two feature importance was analysed and applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **<u>Conclusion</u>** section is a summary of the results obtained from the three selected models and states the final conclusion."
